== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the beta tester plugin to update to the nightly builds? =

Not just yet, but that feature is coming.

= I'm not seeing the update notification. What's up? =

If you activate the plugin and do not see the update notification, that likely means that there is no beta release currently available. However, if you know there is a beta update available, and still do not see the notification, try visiting the "Dashboard -> Updates" screen and look for the update there.
